# Reliability Metrics to Evaluate Saliency Maps

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the paper:
TODO

## Requirements

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to run the code. The code was tested using Python 3.10.*. To install the required packages, run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate Saliency Maps, run the following command:

```bash
cd src
python SaliencyGen.py
```

## Pretrained Models

The weights for the pretrained ResNet50 model on the CUB-200-2011 dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://fkd-ds.synology.me/web_data/meta_xai_paper_2023/ResNet50.pth). The weights should be placed at the following location: `src/output/weights/ResNet50.pth`.

## Saliency Maps

The saliency maps generated by the code can be downloaded from [here](https://fkd-ds.synology.me/).

The .pkl file consists of multiple pickled objects. It is reccommened to unpickle each file in a loop until the EOF is reached. Each object is a tuple of the form `(index, image, saliency_map)`. The `index` is the index of the image in the dataset, `image` is the 3D image in the form of a numpy array and `saliency_map` is the saliency map in the form of a numpy array.
